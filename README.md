# COMP 421 Lab 3 - File System

### Team Info
- Alex Berlaga - awb4
- Eduardo Landin - eal9

### Implementation Details

##### `iolib.a`


##### `yfs`


### Testing

Tested using the test files in `clear/courses/comp421/pub/samples-lab3`. We also used the tests in the following GitHub repos: 
- https://github.com/pjgranahan/yfs-tests 
- https://github.com/cannontwo/Comp-421-Tests/tree/master/lab3/wcl2

We tested each of the calls in `iolib.a`, with the exception of `SymLink` and `ReadLink`. We did not implement symbolic links. Based on these tests, we believe that all of the other methods in `iolib.a` work correctly and as expected.
